TODOS: 
- [ ] incorporate the edit courses (not done yet, but some of the code is there: 
    make sure to double check routes.py, flux.js, courseTracker.js, possibly the Course.jsx)
- [ ] courseTracker.js: In the other details input, put some margin/padding below the flating label (or padding top to the actual value)
- [ ] add an option to see the details
- [ ] add a habit tracker page as well maybe?
