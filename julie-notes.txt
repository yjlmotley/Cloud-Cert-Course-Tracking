TODOS: 
- [ ] make the courses sortable by expected start date, start date, due date, by course number, course number, maybe a custom option so the users can move it around as needed
- [ ] when editing or adding a new course finishes, I want the page to go back to the top of the screen possibly
- [ ] courseTracker.js: In the other details input, put some margin/padding below the flating label (or padding top to the actual value)
- [ ] add an option to see the details
- [ ] add a habit tracker page as well maybe?
